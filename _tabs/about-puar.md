## Puar (普洱)
Puar is a female domestic shorthair cat. Her name creatively echoes the sound of 'purr' and is a tribute to the anime character [Puar](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Puar) from Dragon Ball. Interestingly, Puar's Chinese name, [普洱](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu%27er_tea), also denotes a type of Chinese tea and mirrors the pattern of Puar's fur. And puar has her [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/puar_my_cat/?hl=en) account.<br /> 

I adopted her from [Philly PAWS](https://phillypaws.org) on July 22, 2017, when she was just 3 months old. Originally found near 50th Street at a tender age of one month, Puar had a distinctive 90-degree kink in her tail, a healed reminder of an unknown injury. At the time of adoption, she was recovering from an ear infection. <br /> 

During my visit to Philly PAWS, there were three kittens available for adoption. My initial attention was drawn to a lively and playful kitten adjacent to Puar, who was asleep. This kitten was energetic, constantly engaged with a ball, and had a fuller, healthier face compared to Puar, who looked a bit emaciated.<br /> 

However, the staff wisely advised me to select a pet based on their personality rather than appearance. They asked me to envision a scene of watching TV at home: Puar, they suggested, would likely be a 'cuddle cat', whereas the playful one might prefer to amuse herself on the floor. Inspired by the prospect of a TV-watching companion, I chose Puar.<br /> 

Puar turned out to be a real angel. She quickly learned not to interfere with human food and has never knocked anything over. She's exceptionally friendly to human visitors but isn't fond of other animals. In March 2018, I brought Puar back with me to China, where she now lives happily with my parents.<br />
