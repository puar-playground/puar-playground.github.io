    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are bound to their tokenizer, which maps raw text to a sequence of vocabulary items (tokens). This restricts their flexibility: for example, LMs trained primarily on English may still perform well in other natural and programming languages, but have vastly decreased efficiency due to their English-centric tokenizer. To mitigate this, we should be able to swap the original LM tokenizer with an arbitrary one, on the fly, without degrading performance. Hence, in this work we define a new problem: Zero-Shot Tokenizer Transfer (ZeTT). The challenge at the core of ZeTT is finding embeddings for the tokens in the vocabulary of the new tokenizer. Since prior heuristics for initializing embeddings often perform at chance level in a ZeTT setting, we propose a new solution: we train a hypernetwork taking a tokenizer as input and predicting the corresponding embeddings. We empirically demonstrate that the hypernetwork generalizes to new tokenizers both with encoder (e.g., XLM-R) and decoder LLMs (e.g., Mistral-7B). Our method comes close to the original models' performance in cross-lingual and coding tasks while markedly reducing the length of the tokenized sequence. We also find that the remaining gap can be quickly closed by continued training on less than 1B tokens. Finally, we show that a ZeTT hypernetwork trained for a base (L)LM can also be applied to fine-tuned variants without extra training. Overall, our results make substantial strides toward detaching LMs from their tokenizer.",

However, adapting these decoder-only LLMs to new tasks across languages remains challenging. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored, especially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark. Similar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well. Despite using only 1.23M learning parameters with prefix tuning, we achieve consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of prefix-based techniques as an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA, particularly in low-resource multilingual settings.",

The dense reasoning is achieved by the Dense Reasoner, which performs LLM-style reasoning directly in the embedding space, enabling a controllable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration. These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.",

While prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic, Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp, GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over strong baselines.",

Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.",

Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception, Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.",

It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48 fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration. Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to video-induced attacks.

    "abstract": "Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources, such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths. Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning benchmarks by more than 8%.",

Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments.

However, most existing augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes -- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to task utility-centric data augmentation.",

    "abstract": "Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations, segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements across diverse medical vision-language tasks.

    "abstract": "Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency. In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation. Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion methods.

    "abstract": "Wi-Fi sensing systems are severely hindered by cross domain problem when deployed in unseen real-world environments. Existing methods typically design separate frameworks for either domain adaptation or domain generalization, often relying on extensive labeled data. Existing methods that designed for domain generalization is often relying on extensive labeled data. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex, where the deployed model must be capable of handling generalization under limited labeled source data. To this end, we propose UniCrossFi, a unified framework designed to mitigate performance drop in CSI-based sensing across diverse deployment settings. Our framework not only extends conventional Domain Generalization (DG) to a more practical Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) setting, where only partially labeled source data are available, but also introduces a physics-informed data augmentation strategy, Antenna Response Consistency (ARC). ARC mitigates the risk of learning superficial shortcuts by exploiting the intrinsic spatial diversity of multi-antenna systems, treating signals from different antennas as naturally augmented views of the same event. In addition, we design a Unified Contrastive Objective to prevent conventional contrastive learning from pushing apart samples from different domains that share the same class. We conduct extensive experiments on the public Widar and CSIDA datasets. The results demonstrate that UniCrossFi consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods across all unsupervised domain adaptation, DG, and SSDG benchmarks. UniCrossFi provides a principled and practical solution to the domain shift challenge, advancing the feasibility of robust, real-world Wi-Fi sensing systems that can operate effectively with limited labeled data.",

    "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the de facto parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for large language models (LLMs) by constraining weight updates to low-rank matrices. Recent works such as Tied-LoRA, VeRA, and VB-LoRA push efficiency further by introducing additional constraints to reduce the trainable parameter space. In this paper, we show that the parameter space reduction strategies employed by these LoRA variants can be formulated within a unified framework, Uni-LoRA, where the LoRA parameter space, flattened as a high-dimensional vector space $R^D$, can be reconstructed through a projection from a subspace R^d, with $d \\ll D$. We demonstrate that the fundamental difference among various LoRA methods lies in the choice of the projection matrix, $P \\in R^{D \\times d}$.Most existing LoRA variants rely on layer-wise or structure-specific projections that limit cross-layer parameter sharing, thereby compromising parameter efficiency. In light of this, we introduce an efficient and theoretically grounded projection matrix that is isometric, enabling global parameter sharing and reducing computation overhead. Furthermore, under the unified view of Uni-LoRA, this design requires only a single trainable vector to reconstruct LoRA parameters for the entire LLM - making Uni-LoRA both a unified framework and a \"one-vector-only\" solution. Extensive experiments on GLUE, mathematical reasoning, and instruction tuning benchmarks demonstrate that Uni-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art parameter efficiency while outperforming or matching prior approaches in predictive performance.

In this paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.",

We propose an approximate, distributed, accelerated sketch-and-project algorithm ($\\texttt{ADASAP}$) for solving these linear systems, which improves scalability. We use the theory of determinantal point processes to show that the posterior mean induced by sketch-and-project rapidly converges to the true posterior mean. In particular, this yields the first efficient, condition number-free algorithm for estimating the posterior mean along the top spectral basis functions, showing that our approach is principled for GP inference. $\\texttt{ADASAP}$ outperforms state-of-the-art solvers based on conjugate gradient and coordinate descent across several benchmark datasets and a large-scale Bayesian optimization task.

This assumption simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning, which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data. CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2 with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all datasets.

We propose a discretized approach where we find many discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\\textit{Segmented Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point. Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in distance between $5\\%$ to $50\\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints) counterfactual explanations.

    "abstract": "Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.",

    "abstract": "Dark matter makes up approximately 85% of total matter in our universe, yet it has never been directly observed in any laboratory on Earth. The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release enables core AI algorithms to extract the dark matter signal and produce real physics results thereby advancing fundamental science.

This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on Moiré-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF, DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera angles. To further examine the influence of Moiré patterns on deepfake detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoiréFake, referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moiré generation techniques. Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moiré artifacts degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moiré patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoiréing methods, intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for detection models that can robustly handle Moiré distortions alongside other realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.",

Our approach uses Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50% computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.",

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers. However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate of $20\\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\\%$ on LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\\%$-$30.52\\%$. Furthermore, CLP can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with only a slight performance loss.",

    "abstract": "The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at performing certain tasks at \"super-human levels\". This has incentivized the community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics. Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points: (i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered \"saturated\", can be effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.",

In this paper, we explore an extension to an established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant entities.

    "abstract": "Large language model agents are increasingly used in multi-turn conversational settings to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic environments. However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by default, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the real-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability when an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has passed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often either over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or under-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge, we introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across 34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user question, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed since the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue messages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and evolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples, creating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous observation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call (prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with human preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show that without time information, most models perform only slightly better than random, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding timestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the improvement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive, prompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness. Our findings highlight the need for specific post-training alignment to align multi-turn LLM tool use with human temporal perception.",

Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification.

In SynthWorlds, we construct parallel corpora representing two worlds with identical interconnected structure: a real-mapped world, where models may exploit parametric knowledge, and a synthetic-mapped world, where such knowledge is meaningless. On top of these corpora, we design two mirrored tasks as case studies: multi-hop question answering and page navigation, which maintain equal reasoning difficulty across worlds. Experiments in parametric-only (e.g., closed-book QA) and knowledge-augmented (e.g., retrieval-augmented) LM settings reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap, defined as the performance boost models gain from memorized parametric world knowledge. Knowledge acquisition and integration mechanisms reduce but do not eliminate this gap, highlighting opportunities for system improvements.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OvOD) is set to revolutionize security screening by enabling systems to recognize any item in X-ray scans. However, developing effective OvOD models for X-ray imaging presents unique challenges due to data scarcity and the modality gap that prevents direct adoption of RGB-based solutions. To overcome these limitations, we propose RAXO, a training-free framework that repurposes off-the-shelf RGB OvOD detectors for robust X-ray detection. RAXO builds high-quality X-ray class descriptors using a dual-source retrieval strategy. It gathers relevant RGB images from the web and enriches them via a novel X-ray material transfer mechanism, eliminating the need for labeled databases. These visual descriptors replace text-based classification in OvOD, leveraging intra-modal feature distances for robust detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAXO consistently improves OvOD performance, providing an average mAP increase of up to 17.0 points over base detectors. To further support research in this emerging field, we also introduce DET-COMPASS, a new benchmark featuring bounding box annotations for over 300 object categories, enabling large-scale evaluation of OvOD in X-ray.

One manifestation of this is the formation of ad hoc linguistic conventions, which allow people to coordinate on short, less costly utterances that are understood using shared conversational context. We present a method to train large multimodal models to form conventions, enabling efficient communication. Our approach uses simulated reference games between models, and requires no additional human-produced data. In repeated reference games involving photographs and tangram images, our method enables models to communicate efficiently with people: reducing the message length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over the course of the interaction. Human listeners respond faster when interacting with our model that forms conventions. We also show that training based on success or cost alone is insufficient - both are necessary to elicit convention formation.",

We propose MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion, we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a 27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.",

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding is a technique to leverage hardware concurrency in order to enable multiple steps of token generation in a single forward pass, thus improving the efficiency of large-scale autoregressive (AR) Transformer models. State-space models (SSMs) are already more efficient than AR Transformers, since their state summarizes all past data with no need to cache or re-process tokens in the sliding window context. However, their state can also comprise thousands of tokens; so, speculative decoding has recently been extended to SSMs. Existing approaches, however, do not leverage the tree-based verification methods, since current SSMs lack the means to compute a token tree efficiently. We propose the first scalable algorithm to perform tree-based speculative decoding in state-space models (SSMs) and hybrid architectures of SSMs and Transformer layers. We exploit the structure of accumulated state transition matrices to facilitate tree-based speculative decoding with minimal overhead relative to current SSM implementations. Along with the algorithm, we describe a hardware-aware implementation that improves naive application of AR Transformer tree-based speculative decoding methods to SSMs. Furthermore, we outperform vanilla speculative decoding with SSMs even with a baseline drafting model and tree structure on three different benchmarks, opening up opportunities for further speed up with SSM and hybrid model inference.

STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\\% temporal, -35.2\\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.",

This indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic, token-level gating mechanism inspired by the \"propose-and-verify\" paradigm of speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively applied only to \"accepted\" tokens, while \"rejected\" tokens are masked out. Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art results.",

To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases, we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models.

A transformer-based acoustic event detection module identifies relevant temporal segments containing tool-tissue interactions which are spatially localized in the audio-visual scene representation.

To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence. Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by up to 60%.

Our hierarchies capture different dimensions of research contributions, reflecting the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of modern science. We evaluate its utility by measuring how effectively an LLM-based agent can navigate the hierarchy to locate target papers. Results show that our method improves interpretability and offers an alternative pathway for exploring scientific literature beyond traditional search methods.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting, this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.",

Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats, requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks, which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm, a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party (VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while being over 16x faster.

Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees (RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training. The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets. Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization ability in four hours.",

Despite its notable success in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied in a wide array of settings, well beyond the typical language-oriented use cases. In particular, LLMs are increasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating predictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised learning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a critical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data representation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task can drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply changing variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82% in certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to task-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we discover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable names/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive more attention when output tokens are generated, even though different positions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially explains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also consider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained specifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve prediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant variations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities, currently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a principled data-fitting tool.",

Yet, despite its importance, little attention has been given to establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP) has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees. Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability of CP under CDP scenarios.

    "abstract": "Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately, performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve 80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved 75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and can achieve strong results.",

We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games, route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual foundation models.",

    "abstract": "The transformation of unstructured legal contracts into standardized, machine-readable formats is essential for automating financial workflows. The Common Domain Model (CDM) provides a standardized framework for this purpose, but converting complex legal documents like Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) into CDM representations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present an extension of the CDMizer framework, a template-driven solution that ensures syntactic correctness and adherence to the CDM schema during contract-to-CDM conversion. We apply this extended framework to a real-world task, comparing its performance with a benchmark developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) for CSA clause extraction. Our results show that CDMizer, when integrated with a significantly smaller, open-source Large Language Model (LLM), achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency against larger, proprietary models. This work underscores the potential of resource-efficient solutions to automate legal contract transformation, offering a cost-effective and scalable approach that can meet the needs of financial institutions with constrained resources or strict data privacy requirements.",

However, prevailing training methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative \"near-miss\" samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to effectively learn from these \"near-misses\". Experiments on diverse question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls, demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents.",

However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under 20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale, expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific research.",

We introduce relative scaling laws, which track how performance gaps between test distributions evolve with scale rather than focusing solely on absolute error. Using 255 decoder-only Transformers trained under matched-compute (IsoFLOP) budgets from $10^{18}$--$10^{20}$ FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, we find diverse trajectories: academic domains on MMLU converge toward parity; regional English dialects shift depending on population size; and clusters of AI risk behaviours split, with capability- and influence-related risks increasing during pretraining while adversarial risks do not. These results show that although scaling improves overall performance, it is not a universal equalizer.

However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimizations to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed Reasoning Compiler) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-informed transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. MCTS incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.",

Such approaches require transforming RDBs into graphs, a process we refer to as RDB-to-graph modeling, where rows of tables are represented as nodes and foreign-key relationships as edges. Yet, effective modeling of RDBs into graphs remains challenging. Specifically, there exist numerous ways to model RDBs into graphs, and performance on predictive tasks varies significantly depending on the chosen graph model of RDBs. In our analysis, we find that the best-performing graph model can yield up to a 10% higher performance compared to the common heuristic rule for graph modeling, which remains non-trivial to identify. To foster research on intelligent RDB-to-graph modeling, we introduce RDB2G-Bench, the first benchmark framework for evaluating such methods. We construct extensive datasets covering 5 real-world RDBs and 12 predictive tasks, resulting in around 50k graph model-performance pairs for efficient and reproducible evaluations. Thanks to our precomputed datasets, we were able to benchmark 10 automatic RDB-to-graph modeling methods on the 12 tasks about 380x faster than on-the-fly evaluation, which requires repeated GNN training.

Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation.

We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions.

While existing ultra-low-bit PTQ methods rely on binary approximations or complex compensation mechanisms, they suffer from either limited representational capacity or computational overhead that undermines their efficiency gains. We introduce PTQ to Trit-Planes (PTQTP), the first ternary-weight PTQ framework that decomposes weight matrices into structured ternary {-1, 0, 1} trit-planes using 2x1.58-bit representation. PTQTP achieves multiplication-free inference, identical to 1-bit quantization, while maintaining superior expressiveness through its novel structured decomposition. Our approach provides: (1) a theoretically grounded progressive approximation algorithm ensuring global weight consistency; (2) model-agnostic deployment across diverse modern LLMs without architectural modifications; and (3) uniform ternary operations that eliminate the need for mixed-precision or compensation schemes. Comprehensive experiments across LLaMA3.x and Qwen3 model families (0.6B-70B parameters) demonstrate that PTQTP significantly outperforms existing low-bit PTQ methods, achieving 82.4% mathematical reasoning retention versus 0% for competing approaches. PTQTP approaches and sometimes surpasses 1.58-bit quantization-aware training performance while requiring only single-hour quantization compared to 10-14 GPU days for training-based methods. These results establish PTQTP as a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments. The code will be available at https://github.com/HeXiao-55/PTQTP.",

    "abstract": "We propose two simple, principled and practical algorithms that enjoy provable scaling laws for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them via a knockout tournament for the final output. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure probability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute. Both algorithms require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation, which makes them appealing for practical applications and easy to adapt for different tasks. Through extensive experiments with diverse models and datasets, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability. Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates. Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and matches on-policy performance.",

We introduce PRISM-Bench, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.",

Here we demonstrate that pre-trained knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm. Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768-5,684 experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain systematically higher exploration Shannon entropy than BO across all datasets while achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails-suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories.

However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io",

Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs, PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

While generative reward models (GRMs) offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand, point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals, eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its effectiveness and robustness.

To build AI systems with this capability, we must first understand its building blocks: does such flexibility require explicit, dedicated mechanisms for modelling others -- or can it emerge spontaneously from the pressures of open-ended cooperative interaction? To investigate this question, we train simple model-free RNN agents to collaborate with a population of diverse partners. Using the `Overcooked-AI' environment, we collect data from thousands of collaborative teams, and analyse agents' internal hidden states. Despite a lack of additional architectural features, inductive biases, or auxiliary objectives, the agents nevertheless develop structured internal representations of their partners' task abilities, enabling rapid adaptation and generalisation to novel collaborators. We investigated these internal models through probing techniques, and large-scale behavioural analysis. Notably, we find that structured partner modelling emerges when agents can influence partner behaviour by controlling task allocation. Our results show that partner modelling can arise spontaneously in model-free agents -- but only under environmental conditions that impose the right kind of social pressure.",

To address these issues, we propose ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final answer.

Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, \\ie, automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

Past evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP, the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents' tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1% to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge.

Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output selected via majority voting over their executions.",

    "abstract": "As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes increasingly widespread, the role of information retrieval (IR) is shifting from retrieving information for human users to retrieving contextual knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI) systems, where relevance becomes difficult to define or annotate beforehand. To address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning, R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical, requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.",

    "abstract": "Surround sound systems commonly distribute loudspeakers along standardized layouts for multichannel audio reproduction. However in less controlled environments, practical layouts vary in loudspeaker quantity, placement, and listening locations / areas. Deviations from standard layouts introduce sound-field errors that degrade acoustic timbre, imaging, and clarity of audio content reproduction. This work introduces both Bayesian loudspeaker normalization and content panning optimization methods for sound-field correction. Conjugate prior distributions over loudspeaker-listener directions update estimated layouts for non-stationary listening locations; digital filters adapt loudspeaker acoustic responses to a common reference target at the estimated listening area without acoustic measurements. Frequency-domain panning coefficients are then optimized via sensitivity / efficiency objectives subject to spatial, electrical, and acoustic domain constraints; normalized and panned loudspeakers form virtual loudspeakers in standardized layouts for accurate multichannel reproduction. Experiments investigate robustness of Bayesian adaptation, and panning optimizations in practical applications.",

However, a single beamformer cannot adapt to varying acoustic conditions, which limits its interference suppression capability. To address this, adaptive convex combination (ACC) algorithms have been introduced, where the outputs of multiple fixed beamformers are linearly combined to improve robustness. Nevertheless, ACC often fails in highly non-stationary scenarios, such as rapidly moving interference, since its adaptive updates cannot reliably track rapid changes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a frame-online neural fusion framework for multiple distortionless differential beamformers, which estimates the combination weights through a neural network. Compared with conventional ACC, the proposed method adapts more effectively to dynamic acoustic environments, achieving stronger interference suppression while maintaining the distortionless constraint.",

However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.",

However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation (TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content. Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images, target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and is comparable with specialist methods.",

To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs structured event hypotheses.

In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

Addressing these issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its generality.

    "abstract": "Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.",

ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance, when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set, i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs, and thus ME-POMDPs.

Encoder-decoder architectures have become the widely used approach for RSIC by translating visual content into descriptive text. However, many existing methods rely on a single-stream architecture, which weakens the model to accurately describe the image. Such single-stream architectures typically struggle to extract diverse spatial features or capture complex semantic relationships, limiting their effectiveness in scenes with high intraclass similarity or contextual ambiguity. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-stream Encoder-decoder Framework (MsEdF) which improves the performance of RSIC by optimizing both the spatial representation and language generation of encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder fuses information from two complementary image encoders, thereby promoting feature diversity through the integration of multiscale and structurally distinct cues. To improve the capture of context-aware descriptions, we refine the input sequence's semantic modeling on the decoder side using a stacked GRU architecture with an element-wise aggregation scheme.

To address this challenge, we propose Motion-Primitive Transformer (MoPFormer), a novel self-supervised framework that enhances interpretability by tokenizing inertial measurement unit signals into semantically meaningful motion primitives and leverages a Transformer architecture to learn rich temporal representations. MoPFormer comprises two stages. The first stage is to partition multi-channel sensor streams into short segments and quantize them into discrete ``motion primitive'' codewords, while the second stage enriches those tokenized sequences through a context-aware embedding module and then processes them with a Transformer encoder. The proposed MoPFormer can be pre-trained using a masked motion-modeling objective that reconstructs missing primitives, enabling it to develop robust representations across diverse sensor configurations. Experiments on six HAR benchmarks demonstrate that MoPFormer not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also successfully generalizes across multiple datasets. More importantly, the learned motion primitives significantly enhance both interpretability and cross-dataset performance by capturing fundamental movement patterns that remain consistent across similar activities, regardless of dataset origin.",

Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting.

    "abstract": "Despite recent efforts in Large Language Model (LLM) safety and alignment, current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs can still consistently force harmful generations. Although adversarial training has been widely studied and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous relaxations. At the same time, despite their effectiveness and generalization capabilities, training with continuous perturbations does not always capture the full spectrum of vulnerabilities exploited by discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT, a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate (ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation, revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead, highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and models at https://github.com/insait-institute/MixAT.",

Yet most industrial deployments remain proprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected scaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training recipe that enables competitive performance?\n  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully open-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end workflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and recommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual Quantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward trend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size, validating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach.

We present ARCIS, an efficient algorithm for mining large independent sets on massive graphs. ARCIS couples two main components. The first is an adaptive restart policy that refreshes exploration when progress slows. The second is Consensus-Guided Vertex Fixing, which restricts the search to the non-consensus region of the graph by fixing vertices consistently observed within a round. The consensus is maintained as a running intersection within each round, and because it is recomputed at every restart, the fixing is reversible. Vertices that later lose support are automatically unfixed and their neighborhoods re-enter the working graph, which corrects occasional mistakes while preserving progress. Experiments on 222 graphs from four benchmark suites show that ARCIS attains the best or tied-best solution quality in most instances while delivering competitive runtime and low variability. Ablation studies isolate the impact of each component, indicating that ARCIS is a practical and robust method for large-scale graph mining.",

We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective replies.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, many generalization benchmarks have shown language models' lack of robustness in natural language inference (NLI). However, manually creating new benchmarks is costly, while automatically generating high-quality ones, even by modifying existing benchmarks, is extremely difficult. In this paper, we propose a methodology for automatically generating high-quality variants of original NLI problems by replacing open-class words, while crucially preserving their underlying reasoning. We dub our generalization test as MERGE (Minimal Expression-Replacements GEneralization), which evaluates the correctness of models' predictions across reasoning-preserving variants of the original problem. Our results show that NLI models' perform 4-20% worse on variants, suggesting low generalizability even on such minimally altered problems. We also analyse how word class of the replacements, word probability, and plausibility influence NLI models' performance.",

    "abstract": "Distilling the tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for their practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation, MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a teacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL baselines.",

Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.",

However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy visual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context length cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant frames hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial. This paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles: query relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such as uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these principles. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with dynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and model-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the query using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert space~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the similarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To incorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each segment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov decision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments. Theoretically, MDP3 provides a \\((1 - 1/e)\\)-approximate solution to the NP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time complexity, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, MDP3 significantly outperforms existing methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.",

To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery.

Results from all analyses suggest that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.

Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005) and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited effect in our benchmarks.

However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis. Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster, more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon publication.",

LongWeave supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world complexity and output length increase.",

It is adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, and text over 4K frames or 1M tokens while delivering advanced performances on short-context multi-modal tasks. We propose an effective multi-modal training schema that starts with large language models and proceeds through vision-language alignment, general knowledge learning, and two sequential stages of long-sequence fine-tuning. We further implement context-parallelism distributed inference and logits-masked language modeling head to scale Long-VITA to infinitely long inputs of images and texts during model inference. Regarding training data, Long-VITA is built on a mix of 17M samples from public datasets only and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various multi-modal benchmarks, compared against recent cutting-edge models with internal data. Long-VITA is fully open-source and reproducible.. By leveraging our inference designs, Long-VITA models achieve a remarkable 2x prefill speedup and 4x context length extension in a single node with 8 GPUs. We hope Long-VITA can serve as a competitive baseline and offer valuable insights for the open-source community in advancing long-context multi-modal understanding.",

However, existing datasets remain focus on short video clips within several seconds, with salient objects visible in most frames. To advance the task towards more practical scenarios, we introduce \\textbf{Long-RVOS}, a large-scale benchmark for long-term referring video object segmentation. Long-RVOS contains 2,000+ videos of an average duration exceeding 60 seconds, covering a variety of objects that undergo occlusion, disappearance-reappearance and shot changing. The objects are manually annotated with three different types of descriptions to individually evaluate the understanding of static attributes, motion patterns and spatiotemporal relationships. Moreover, unlike previous benchmarks that rely solely on the per-frame spatial evaluation, we introduce two new metrics to assess the temporal and spatiotemporal consistency. We benchmark 6 state-of-the-art methods on Long-RVOS. The results show that current approaches struggle severely with the long-video challenges. To address this, we further propose ReferMo, a promising baseline method that integrates motion information to expand the temporal receptive field, and employs a local-to-global architecture to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies. Despite simplicity, ReferMo achieves significant improvements over current methods in long-term scenarios. We hope that Long-RVOS and our baseline can drive future RVOS research towards tackling more realistic and long-form videos.",

    "abstract": "The quadratic cost of attention hinders the scalability of long-context LLMs, especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing static sparse methods such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention (DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device LLMs.",

    "abstract": "In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments, local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples, which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU), extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions, including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.",

One of the major difficulties to overcome is the so-called domain mismatch between the anomaly score distributions of a source domain and a target domain that differ acoustically and in terms of the amount of training data provided. A decision threshold that is optimal for one domain may be highly sub-optimal for the other domain and vice versa. This significantly degrades the performance when only using a single decision threshold, as is required when generalizing to multiple data domains that are possibly unseen during training while still using the same trained ASD system as in the source domain. To reduce this mismatch between the domains, we propose a simple local-density-based anomaly score normalization scheme. In experiments conducted on several ASD datasets, we show that the proposed normalization scheme consistently improves performance for various types of embedding-based ASD systems and yields better results than existing anomaly score normalization approaches.",

LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error bounds.

LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW. LittleBit establishes a new, viable size-performance trade-off--unlocking a potential 11.6$\\times$ speedup over FP16 at the kernel level--and makes powerful LLMs practical for resource-constrained environments.",

We address these questions by conducting systematic modality robustness tests on LAVCap, a state-of-the-art audio-visual captioning model, in which we selectively suppress or corrupt the audio or visual streams to quantify sensitivity and complementarity. The analysis reveals a pronounced bias toward the audio stream in LAVCap.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures, enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/LinearRAG.",

However, both directions rely heavily on costly and labor-intensive labeled data and field measurements, which constrains their scalability and spatiotemporal adaptability. Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) provides a unified framework to address these limitations. This paper departs from the traditional view that treats interpretation and inversion as separate tasks and offers a systematic review of recent advances in LiDAR remote sensing from a unified WSL perspective. We cover typical WSL settings including incomplete supervision(e.g., sparse point labels), inexact supervision (e.g., scene-level tags), inaccurate supervision (e.g., noisy labels), and cross-domain supervision (e.g., domain adaptation/generalization) and corresponding techniques such as pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, self-training, and label refinement, which collectively enable robust learning from limited and weak annotations.We further analyze LiDAR-specific challenges (e.g., irregular geometry, data sparsity, domain heterogeneity) that require tailored weak supervision, and examine how sparse LiDAR observations can guide joint learning with other remote-sensing data for continuous surface-parameter retrieval. Finally, we highlight future directions where WSL acts as a bridge between LiDAR and foundation models to leverage large-scale multimodal datasets and reduce labeling costs, while also enabling broader WSL-driven advances in generalization, open-world adaptation, and scalable LiDAR remote sensing.",

    "abstract": "Many words are ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). However, when a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced. Disambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS associated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging. The problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language processing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking, expression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc. Lexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural language processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce multiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct solution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence rate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is unrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a lexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate and implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal description of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation grammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer paths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a combination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by considering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling of a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come spontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often due to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is targeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed specification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be necessary.",

While deep learning models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success, they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To address this, we introduce a novel \\textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction (RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \\textbf{reference target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream architecture. It provides strong \\textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong \\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error divergence in long-term rollouts.",

    "abstract": "Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico, an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.",

    "abstract": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this, we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone. It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications.

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates, enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s. 90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA. Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9% across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.

We present PerFine, a unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp, Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5 refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and model-agnostic.",

However, these search agents assume user queries are complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search. Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context, exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold, revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents.

The results show that the metamodel is able to outperform a series of benchmark models, and demonstrates a novel strategy for making efficient use of data for inference in populations of structures, in particular where correlations exist in the variable(s) of interest (such as those from wind-turbine wake-effects).",

Improving oversight quality can be expensive or infeasible, motivating methods that improve learned behavior despite an imperfect training signal. We introduce Inoculation Prompting (IP), a simple but counterintuitive technique that prevents learning of an undesired behavior by modifying training prompts to explicitly request it. For example, to inoculate against reward hacking, we modify the prompts used in supervised fine-tuning to request code that only works on provided test cases but fails on other inputs. Across four settings we find that IP reduces the learning of undesired behavior without substantially reducing the learning of desired capabilities. We also show that prompts which more strongly elicit the undesired behavior prior to fine-tuning more effectively inoculate against the behavior when used during training; this serves as a heuristic to identify promising inoculation prompts. Overall, IP is a simple yet effective way to control how models generalize from fine-tuning, preventing learning of undesired behaviors without substantially disrupting desired capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14), partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world deployment.",

Current LLM reasoning, hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services. Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1) \\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \\textit{content parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\\ie, efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75% through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.",

However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism inspired by experience replay in traditional RL. This technique reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates. Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 23% to 62% while reaching the same level of performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

    "abstract": "The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

    "abstract": "Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision boundaries.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server, leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $α= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\\% in the communication cost, while attaining a 10.88\\% performance gain.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage. Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis, we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation, which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge categorization by showing a significant difference between the two hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that consider the hallucination underlying factors.",

Recent work integrates Gaussian Splatting (GS) into SLAM to enable dense, photorealistic 3D mapping, yet existing GS-based SLAM methods require per-scene optimization that is slow and consumes an excessive number of Gaussians. We present GS4, the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM system. Compared with prior approaches, GS4 runs 10x faster, uses 10x fewer Gaussians, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across color, depth, semantic mapping and camera tracking. From an RGB-D video stream, GS4 incrementally builds and updates a set of 3D Gaussians using a feed-forward network. First, the Gaussian Prediction Model estimates a sparse set of Gaussian parameters from input frame, which integrates both color and semantic prediction with the same backbone. Then, the Gaussian Refinement Network merges new Gaussians with the existing set while avoiding redundancy. Finally, we propose to optimize GS for only 1-5 iterations that corrects drift and floaters when significant pose changes are detected. Experiments on the real-world ScanNet and ScanNet++ benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance, with strong generalization capability shown through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.",

To mitigate these challenges, we propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases. Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves performance and training efficiency.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, their scalability to multi-turn LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on challenging agent benchmarks, including ALFWorld and WebShop, as well as tool-integrated reasoning on search-augmented QA tasks, using Qwen2.5-1.5B/3B/7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals, achieves performance gains of > 12% on ALFWorld and > 9% on WebShop over GRPO, and obtains superior performance on QA tasks (42.1% on 3B and 47.2% on 7B): all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.",

    "abstract": "Geospatial pixel reasoning aims to generate segmentation masks in remote sensing imagery directly from natural-language instructions. Most existing approaches follow a paradigm that fine-tunes multimodal large language models under supervision with dense pixel-level masks as ground truth. While effective within the training data distribution, this design suffers from two main drawbacks: (1) the high cost of large-scale dense mask annotation, and (2) the limited generalization capability of supervised fine-tuning in out-of-domain scenarios. To address these issues, we propose GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework that integrates a multimodal large language model with a pretrained segmentation model in a cascaded manner. To enhance generalization, we introduce PRIME, a training paradigm that replaces supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to better align reasoning and grounding behaviors with task objectives. To reduce annotation costs, we design BoP-Rewards, which substitutes dense mask labels with bounding box and positive points. It further verifies outputs through two complementary signals: format, which constrains the reasoning and grounding structure to remain syntactically parsable, and accuracy, which evaluates the quality of predicted boxes and points. For evaluation, we train our method and all baselines on EarthReason and GeoPixInstruct, constructing an in-domain benchmark by merging their test sets. We further release GRASP-1k, a fully out-of-domain benchmark with reasoning-intensive queries, reasoning traces, and fine-grained masks. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) in-domain performance and up to 54\\% improvement in out-of-domain scenarios, confirming that reinforcement learning with cost-aware rewards provides a robust and scalable paradigm for geospatial pixel reasoning.

Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.

Rather than imposing predefined emotion and mood categories, we implement a bottom-up, participant-driven approach to organically elicit culturally specific music-related emotion terms. We then recruit another pool of human participants to collect 988,925 ratings for these culture-specific descriptors. Our analysis confirms the presence of a valence-arousal structure shared across cultures, yet also reveals significant divergences in how certain emotion terms (despite being dictionary equivalents) are perceived cross-culturally. State-of-the-art multimodal models benefit substantially from fine-tuning on our cross-culturally balanced dataset, particularly in non-English contexts. Broadly, our findings inform the ongoing debate on the universality versus cultural specificity of emotional descriptors, and our methodology can contribute to other multimodal and cross-lingual research.",

    "abstract": "To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335 researchers from 65 countries around the world. The 116 language varieties in Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific elements. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally perform worse than proprietary models. Global PIQA highlights that in many languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement, alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language is embedded.",

    "abstract": "I propose \\textbf{G}roup-relative \\textbf{I}mplicit \\textbf{F}ine \\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error (MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2) inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs, and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical development, and beyond.",

Experimental results have shown that GenTrack provides superior performance on standard benchmarks and real-world scenarios compared to state-of-the-art trackers, with integrated implementations of baselines for fair comparison. Potential directions for future work are also discussed.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free, frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera paths, including Oscar Reutersvärd's Impossible Staircase.

    "abstract": "Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language, deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development, (2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5) iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research ethics.",

It promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.",

This paper presents an approach to tackle these difficulties in the domain of chess puzzles. We start by benchmarking Generative AI architectures, and then introduce an RL framework with novel rewards based on chess engine search statistics to overcome some of those shortcomings. The rewards are designed to enhance a puzzle's uniqueness, counter-intuitiveness, diversity, and realism. Our RL approach dramatically increases counter-intuitive puzzle generation by 10x, from 0.22\\% (supervised) to 2.5\\%, surpassing existing dataset rates (2.1\\%) and the best Lichess-trained model (0.4\\%). Our puzzles meet novelty and diversity benchmarks, retain aesthetic themes, and are rated by human experts as more creative, enjoyable, and counter-intuitive than composed book puzzles, even approaching classic compositions. Our final outcome is a curated booklet of these AI-generated puzzles, which is acknowledged for creativity by three world-renowned experts.",

While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to understand and trust model outputs. To address these limitations, this work first proposes a Region-Aware Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (RMCoT) dataset, in which the process of producing an answer is preceded by a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal.

    "abstract": "We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified, scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs. Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.",

As this ability becomes increasingly central to advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods, such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments. Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a reliable and robust source for agentic learning.",

Even the best-performing models, Google Gemini-2.5-Pro and OpenAI o3, achieve just around 30% accuracy on space-level tasks and around 40% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks.

This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method (BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights, we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms, regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math and fact retrieval.",

We develop a Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle. In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical understanding in predictive analytics.

This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks, slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices. Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability, auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.",

In this work, we introduce two frequency-aware frameworks: the Vision Transformer-Tuned Sinusoidal Implicit Representation (ViSIR), combining Vision Transformers and sinusoidal activations to mitigate spectral bias, and the Vision Transformer Fourier Representation Network (ViFOR), which integrates explicit Fourier-based filtering for independent low- and high-frequency learning. Evaluated on the E3SM-HR Earth system dataset across surface temperature, shortwave, and longwave fluxes, these models outperform leading CNN, GAN, and vanilla transformer baselines, with ViFOR demonstrating up to 2.6~dB improvements in PSNR and significantly higher SSIM. Detailed ablation and scaling studies highlight the benefit of full-field training, the impact of frequency hyperparameters, and the potential for generalization. The results establish ViFOR as a state-of-the-art, scalable solution for climate data downscaling.

Among existing approaches, forward convolutional prediction (FCP) has recently attracted attention. It typically employs a deep neural network to predict the direct-path signal and subsequently estimates a linear prediction filter to suppress residual reverberation. However, a major drawback of this approach is that the required linear prediction filter is often excessively long, leading to considerable computational complexity. To address this, our work proposes a novel FCP method based on Kronecker product (KP) decomposition, in which the long prediction filter is modeled as the KP of two much shorter filters. This decomposition significantly reduces the computational cost. An adaptive algorithm is then provided to iteratively update these shorter filters online. Experimental results show that, compared to conventional methods, our approach achieves competitive dereverberation performance while substantially reducing computational cost.",

This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture.

Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization, multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets, including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios. Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.",

Recent works that compress KV caches with prefill acceleration reduce this cost but inadvertently tie the prefill compute reduction to the decoding KV budget. This coupling arises from overlooking the layer-dependent variation of critical context, often leading to accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, a KV cache compression framework designed to reduce latency in both prefill and decoding by leveraging the stabilization of token importance in later layers. FastKV performs full-context computation until a Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) layer, which forwards only the most informative tokens to subsequent layers. From these propagated tokens, FastKV independently selects salient KV entries for caching, thereby decoupling KV budget from the prefill compute reduction based on the TSP decision. This independent control of the TSP rate and KV retention rate enables flexible optimization of efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results show that FastKV achieves speedups of up to 1.82$\\times$ in prefill and 2.87$\\times$ in decoding compared to the full-context baseline, while matching the accuracy of the baselines that only accelerate the decoding stage.

To address this limitation, we propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a 3$\\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale model fine-tuning.

Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34% higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score.

Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features, which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other. This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations, leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14 zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA, especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.",

We define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence, arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological signals.

We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost. Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency compared with global and local sampling strategies.

DynCIM employs a sample-level curriculum to dynamically assess each sample's difficulty according to prediction deviation, consistency, and stability, while a modality-level curriculum measures modality contributions from global and local. Furthermore, a gating-based dynamic fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust modality contributions, minimizing redundancy and optimizing fusion effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption. Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o, demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving AI-powered instructional content generation.",

To address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) including our purposed YOLOv8n-CBAM model using our annotated dataset designed for recycling. We found a clear trade-off between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier, EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy(~ 96%) but suffered from high latency (~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object detection models delivered strong performance (up to 80% mAP) with ultra-fast inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB ), making them ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%.

    "abstract": "Recent studies on end-to-end (E2E) speech generation with large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant community attention, with multiple works extending text-based LLMs to generate discrete speech tokens. Existing E2E approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual modality awareness during generation. This paper presents DrVoice, a parallel speech-text voice conversation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring dual-resolution speech representations. Notably, while current methods utilize mainly 12.5Hz input audio representation, our proposed dual-resolution mechanism reduces the input frequency for the LLM to 5Hz, significantly reducing computational cost and alleviating the frequency discrepancy between speech and text tokens and in turn better exploiting LLMs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DRVOICE-7B establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on OpenAudioBench and Big Bench Audio benchmarks, while achieving performance comparable to the SOTA on VoiceBench and UltraEval-Audio benchmarks, making it a leading open-source speech foundation model in ~7B models.",

Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution, we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of each layer dynamically changes across decoding steps. Building on this insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns precision to each layer based on input values.

    "abstract": "Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance, albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the residual stream of the Llama 3.1, Qwen 3, and OLMo 2 family of models. We find: First, comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half, with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one. We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other, suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer architectures.",

A common practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),\n  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students, residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied\n  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This\n  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,\n  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style. We test this framework on three medical QA\n  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our\n  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they\n  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation\n  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform\n  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the cognitive complexity found in real-world medical\n  practice.

We develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than 100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances.

DiNo measures cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs, while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure. Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25 public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus inference time by up to 95\\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains.

To solve these problems, in this work, we propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths, abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama.

However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments on several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models suffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence and duration of hallucinations by over 50\\% on average, without degrading, and in some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and temporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define, systematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination, paving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.",

However, their fixed attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions, leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential, directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration. Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative performance.",

However, the functional mismatch between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO (LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such systems.",

As such, there is a need to provide transparency in the operation of such ML-enabled sensing systems through comprehensive documentation. This is needed to enable their reproducibility, to address new compliance and auditing regimes mandated in regulation and industry-specific policy, and to verify and validate the responsible nature of their operation. To address this gap, we introduce the datasheet for ML sensors framework.

Our framework addresses the continuous streaming nature of sensor data, real-time processing requirements, and embeds benchmarking methodologies that reflect real-world deployment conditions, ensuring practical viability. Aligned with the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability), our approach enhances the transparency and reusability of ML sensor documentation across academic, industrial, and regulatory domains.

Although modern technology offers unparalleled opportunities for learning, existing automated systems for evaluating recitation have struggled to gain broad acceptance or demonstrate educational effectiveness. This literature review examines this crucial disparity, offering a thorough analysis of scholarly research, digital platforms, and commercial tools developed over the past twenty years. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental flaw in current approaches that adapt Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which emphasize word identification over qualitative acoustic evaluation. These systems suffer from limitations such as reliance on biased datasets, demographic disparities, and an inability to deliver meaningful feedback for improvement. Challenging these data-centric methodologies, we advocate for a paradigm shift toward a knowledge-based computational framework. By leveraging the unchanging nature of the Quranic text and the well-defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that an effective evaluation system should be built upon rule-based acoustic modeling centered on canonical pronunciation principles and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than depending on statistical patterns derived from flawed or biased data. The review concludes that the future of automated Quranic recitation assessment lies in hybrid systems that combine linguistic expertise with advanced audio processing. Such an approach paves the way for developing reliable, fair, and pedagogically effective tools that can authentically assist learners across the globe.",

The performance of multitask learning models depends on the strength of the underlying correlations between tasks and the completeness of the data set. Standard multitask models tend to underperform when trained on sparse data sets with weakly correlated properties. To address this gap, we fuse deep-learned embeddings generated by independent pretrained single-task models, resulting in a multitask model that inherits rich, property-specific representations. By reusing (rather than retraining) these embeddings, the resulting fused model outperforms standard multitask models and can be extended with fewer trainable parameters.

Moreover, we introduce a contrastive objective to enforce identity consistency across different deformed views. Extensive evaluations on low-quality benchmarks including TinyFace, IJB-B, and IJB-C demonstrate that DArFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with significant gains attributed to the inclusion of local deformation modeling.",

Experiments on enterprise email and messaging datasets show that CustomIR consistently improves retrieval effectiveness with small models gaining up to 2.3 points in Recall@10.

While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization that employs a novel contrastive RL algorithm.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves significant performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on A100, it delivers an average speedup of x3.12 with a median speedup of x1.42 against default baselines over across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x120. In addition to the default baseline provided by KernelBench, CUDA-L1 demonstrates x2.77 over Torch Compile, x2.88 over Torch Compile with reduce overhead, x2.81 over CUDA Graph implementations, and remarkably x7.72 over cuDNN libraries. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates portability across different GPU architectures.\n  Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several properties: it 1) discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization, such as the multiplicative nature of optimizations; 3) identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that actually harm performance. The capabilities demonstrate that, RL can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.",

However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains. To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a 5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.",

These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics pathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI based on observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales. Additionally, we construct PathMMU-HR2, the first expert-validated benchmark for large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.",

This mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially, ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity). Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to $1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.",

This paper introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II, and Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against annotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples substantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted enhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities.

This study tackles such difficulties using the Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation. The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings, consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable fault detection in industrial systems.",

Previous works have introduced numerous time-series imputation techniques.

In reality, ad-hoc imputation techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are still used.

We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural, Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore, ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide results and error analyses by category.

Recent efforts increasingly turn to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering, and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit, step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups: continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5, and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.",

Our approach achieves superior average performance on heterogeneous and average treatment effect estimation benchmarks (IHDP, Lalonde, ACIC).

We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust, comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data, ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular datasets.

    "abstract": "Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods. Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic benchmarks ($d{=}\\!3-\\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\\!-\\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\\!-\\!36$), while baselines remain the best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph $F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery.",

However, existing approaches face challenges in mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining the cross-modal generalization capabilities of VLMs. To address these limitations, we propose CalFuse, a framework that synergizes feature Calibration with parameter Fusion to enable effective multi-modal knowledge integration in continual learning scenarios. CalFuse introduces a dynamic feature calibration mechanism that adaptively balances original CLIP visual representations with task-specific features, preserving the model's intrinsic cross-modal generalization while adapting to new classes. Concurrently, a QR decomposition-based parameter fusion strategy progressively integrates newly acquired knowledge with historical task parameters, maintaining equilibrium between learning new class representations and retaining prior knowledge across sequential tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in large-scale multi-modal continual learning settings, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both average accuracy and final task retention.",

Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for medical applications and are evolving rapidly, with new models being released at an accelerated pace. However, benchmarking on large-scale real-world data such as electronic health records (EHRs) is critical, as clinical decisions are directly informed by these sources, yet current evaluations remain limited. Most existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world clinical data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. It covers eight major task types spanning the entire continuum of patient care across six clinical stages and 20 representative applications, including triage and referral, consultation, information extraction, diagnosis, prognosis, and billing coding, and involves 14 clinical specialties. We systematically evaluated 95 LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Gemini series, and Qwen3 series) under various inference strategies. Our results reveal substantial performance variation across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs in real-world clinical text understanding.\n  The BRIDGE leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/YLab-Open/BRIDGE-Medical-Leaderboard",

Despite significant progress in the development of methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in their decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias alignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general augmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is applicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application of augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including state-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to perturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave stereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have biased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community less studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and safety research to include more diverse communities.",

However, misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work, we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.\n  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching. The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.",

However, significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key capabilities -- \\textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving $\\sim\\!\\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\\sim\\!\\textbf{3%}$ in physical tasks.",

Using figurative language as a proxy for cultural nuance and local knowledge, we design evaluation tasks for contextual understanding, pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation in Arabic and English. We evaluate 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on Egyptian Arabic idioms, multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Our results show a consistent hierarchy: the average accuracy for Arabic proverbs is 4.29% lower than for English proverbs, and performance for Egyptian idioms is 10.28% lower than for Arabic proverbs. For the pragmatic use task, accuracy drops by 14.07% relative to understanding, though providing contextual idiomatic sentences improves accuracy by 10.66%. Models also struggle with connotative meaning, reaching at most 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with 100% inter-annotator agreement. These findings demonstrate that figurative language serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning: while LLMs can often interpret figurative meaning, they face challenges in using it appropriately. To support future research, we release Kinayat, the first dataset of Egyptian Arabic idioms designed for both figurative understanding and pragmatic use evaluation.",

We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures (LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics, and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \\$99K in volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios).

It subsumes several existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms competitive baselines.

Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images). In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10 real images.

A key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across LLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility and broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural incompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences between LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer parameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer. Leveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and outperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales. Evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further analysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and provides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.",

Traditional microsaccade studies typically use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees, divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11, Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research.

    "abstract": "Codec-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have recently gained traction for their efficiency and strong performance in voice cloning. However, codec-based TTS faces limitations due to the challenges of pretraining robust speech codecs and the quality degradation introduced by quantization errors. Emerging evidence suggests that continuous-valued generative models can alleviate these issues and serve as a promising alternative. Yet, effectively modelling diverse speech patterns and developing reliable sampling strategies for continuous-valued autoregressive (AR) TTS remains underexplored. In this work, we propose BELLE, Bayesian evidential learning with language modelling for TTS, a novel continuous-valued AR framework that directly predicts mel-spectrograms from textual input. BELLE treats each mel-spectrogram frame as a Gaussian distribution sampled from a learned hyper distribution, enabling principled uncertainty estimation, particularly in scenarios with parallel data (i.e., one text-audio prompt paired with multiple speech samples). To obtain such data, diverse speech samples are synthesized using multiple pre-trained TTS models given the same text-audio prompts, which are distilled into BELLE via Bayesian evidential learning. Experimental results indicate that BELLE demonstrates highly competitive performance compared with the current best open-source TTS models, even though BELLE is trained on a large amount of synthetic data and uses only approximately one-tenth of their training data. Audio samples generated by BELLE are available at https://belletts.github.io/Belle/. The code, checkpoints, and synthetic data will be released after the paper is accepted.",

Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs (e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).",

Instead of matching the original model output distribution token-by-token, we identify which of the generated tokens affect the downstream quality of the response, relaxing the distribution match guarantee so that the \"unimportant\" tokens can be generated faster. Our approach relies on a semi-greedy search algorithm to test which of the mismatches between target and draft models should be corrected to preserve quality and which ones may be skipped. We then train a lightweight classifier based on existing LLM embeddings to predict, at inference time, which mismatching tokens can be safely accepted without compromising the final answer quality. We evaluate the effectiveness of AutoJudge with multiple draft/target model pairs on mathematical reasoning and programming benchmarks, achieving significant speedups at the cost of a minor accuracy reduction. Notably, on GSM8k with the Llama 3.1 70B target model, our approach achieves up to $\\approx2\\times$ speedup over speculative decoding at the cost of $\\le 1\\%$ drop in accuracy.

In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low.

However, current pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g., common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench, a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations after post-training.",

Existing privacy inference attacks towards MU that aim to infer properties of the unlearned set rely on the weaker threat model that assumes the attacker has access to both the unlearned model and the original model, limiting their feasibility toward real-life scenarios. We propose a novel privacy attack, A Posteriori Label-Only Membership Inference Attack towards MU, Apollo, that infers whether a data sample has been unlearned, following a strict threat model where an adversary has access to the label-output of the unlearned model only.

However, their large size presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g., optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered. Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$ sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm.

Existing efforts to mitigate these biases face key limitations: in-context learning-based methods fail to address rooted biases due to the evaluator's limited capacity for self-reflection, whereas fine-tuning is not applicable to all evaluator types, especially closed-source models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Reasoning-based Bias Detector (RBD), which is a plug-in module that identifies biased evaluations and generates structured reasoning to guide evaluator self-correction. Rather than modifying the evaluator itself, RBD operates externally and engages in an iterative process of bias detection and feedback-driven revision. To support its development, we design a complete pipeline consisting of biased dataset construction, supervision collection, distilled reasoning-based fine-tuning of RBD, and integration with LLM evaluators. We fine-tune four sizes of RBD models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B, and observe consistent performance improvements across all scales. Experimental results on 4 bias types--verbosity, position, bandwagon, and sentiment--evaluated using 8 LLM evaluators demonstrate RBD's strong effectiveness. For example, the RBD-8B model improves evaluation accuracy by an average of 18.5% and consistency by 10.9%, and surpasses prompting-based baselines and fine-tuned judges by 12.8% and 17.2%, respectively. These results highlight RBD's effectiveness and scalability. Additional experiments further demonstrate its strong generalization across biases and domains, as well as its efficiency.",

We analyze the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training.

Across downstream tasks, including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base model under identical decoding.

    "abstract": "Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology, vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43); high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions, refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly, transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant mitigation assessment.",

Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like OpenAI's o4-mini.",

In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves as an \"interlingua\" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding, software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments, we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.",

Through detailed threat modeling, experimental benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates, they must be balanced against model performance on clean data.

Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning (AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in 2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM.

In this work, we introduce CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance.

Additionally, both systems often neglect the impact of variations in modality quality. Consequently, modalities suffering substantial corruption may needlessly consume resources better allocated towards other modalities. We propose ADMN, a layer-wise Adaptive Depth Multimodal Network capable of tackling both challenges: it adjusts the total number of active layers across all modalities to meet strict compute resource constraints and continually reallocates layers across input modalities according to their modality quality.

Risk of bias was assessed using the PROBAST tool. Studies analyzing acoustic features between individuals at risk of suicide (RS) and those not at risk (NRS) were included, while studies lacking acoustic data, a suicide-related focus, or sufficient methodological details were excluded. Sample sizes varied widely and were reported in terms of participants or speech segments, depending on the study. Results were synthesized narratively based on acoustic features and classifier performance. Findings consistently showed significant acoustic feature variations between RS and NRS populations, particularly involving jitter, fundamental frequency (F0), Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and power spectral density (PSD). Classifier performance varied based on algorithms, modalities, and speech elicitation methods, with multimodal approaches integrating acoustic, linguistic, and metadata features demonstrating superior performance. Among the 29 classifier-based studies, reported AUC values ranged from 0.62 to 0.985 and accuracies from 60% to 99.85%.

We propose a model that represents the text modality using an encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech component is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model. Our solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former consists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where the 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames, resulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these averaged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to merging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the CATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text and speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the CATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further improve model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during training, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a word error rate (WER) of 0.25 and a character error rate (CER) of 0.9 on the development set. On the test set, our model achieved WER and CER scores of 0.55 and 0.13, respectively.",

    "abstract": "As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible language technologies.",

    "abstract": "For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks, regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models, large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not \"identical twins\". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains, revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the brain.",

As such, game agents offer a valuable testbed for exploring capabilities relevant to Artificial General Intelligence. Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides new opportunities to endow these agents with generalizable reasoning, memory, and adaptability in complex game environments. This survey offers an up-to-date review of LLM-based game agents (LLMGAs) through a unified reference architecture. At the single-agent level, we synthesize existing studies around three core components: memory, reasoning, and perception-action interfaces, which jointly characterize how language enables agents to perceive, think, and act. At the multi-agent level, we outline how communication protocols and organizational models support coordination, role differentiation, and large-scale social behaviors. To contextualize these designs, we introduce a challenge-centered taxonomy linking six major game genres to their dominant agent requirements, from low-latency control in action games to open-ended goal formation in sandbox worlds.

To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement, for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against deliberately evasive models.",

These datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup, addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.",

We introduce a per-token discriminative objective that encourages higher scores for ground-truth phrases while suppressing distractors. Experiments on the Librispeech biasing benchmark show that our method effectively filters out majority of the candidate phrases, and significantly improves recognition accuracy under different biasing conditions when the scores are used in shallow fusion biasing.

We then evaluate the performance of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\\%.

Face forgery techniques, ranging from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which includes forged images generated from four representative methods: text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.",

Despite rapid progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity, disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" model, the trade-off between privacy and representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport applications.",

We address the problem of effectively pruning this search, using only synthetic data generated from previous proof attempts. We first demonstrate that it is possible to generate semantically aware tactic representations which capture the effect on the proving environment, likelihood of success, and execution time. We then propose a novel filtering mechanism which leverages these representations to select semantically diverse and high quality tactics, using Determinantal Point Processes. Our approach, 3D- Prover, is designed to be general, and to augment any underlying tactic generator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Prover on the miniF2F and LeanDojo benchmarks by augmenting popular open source proving LLMs. We show that our approach leads to an increase in the overall proof rate, as well as a significant improvement in the tactic success rate, execution time and diversity.
