[**Sound Lab**](https://puar-playground.github.io/sound_lab/) is an experimental space for exploring sound through the web and is now featured as a core section in the site’s sidebar. It hosts interactive tools for audio visualization, comparison, and critical listening, designed to make sound structures, transformations, and perceptual differences easier to see and hear. The lab serves both as a technical playground and a listening desk—and will continue to evolve over time as new modules, experiments, and listening tools are added directly in the browser.
